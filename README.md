# EllersMazeGenerator
Infinite Maze generator with Eller's algorithm

## Work in progress.

Basically it's working and generating new maze rows while triggering the collision box.

### Known issues:

- Slow maze generation
- Sometimes loops appears (which should not happens with proper Eller's maze)
- No floor generation
- Can't change walls width
- Don't make any cleanup â€“ so created rows always exists
